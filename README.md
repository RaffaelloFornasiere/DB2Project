# TelecoApp

TelecoApp is a Java application that simulates the web services of a telecommunication provider.

## Building




### Backend
Inside the folder DB2Pject-be run the following commands:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run 
```
The server will be listening on default port 8080. In order to change it you can edit the application.properties file uncommenting and setting the following line

```bash
# server.port=8081
```

### Frontend
Go to DB2Project-fe folder and install through npm all the dependecies with the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

Then run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```

After this you should be able to access the application on 
```bash
localhost:4200
```

### Database
If you want to configure your own db you can create a new one from this backup. Then you'll need to edit the application.properties file to make spring connect to that database. 
To import the copy of the database from the file db2_pdb_backup.sql through the commands:
```bash
> mysql -u root -p
mysql> create database db2_pdb;
mysql> use db2_pdb;
mysql> source <path_to_dump>;

```
